# Appointment Scheduling System

## Introduction

This application is part of a future full-stack solution designed for a real IT support consultant. The consultant currently manages bookings through emails and phone calls, which leads to various issues, such as last-minute cancellations and difficulty in keeping track of booking times due to frequent changes.

The purpose of this application is to empower the client to efficiently handle and plan their bookings in advance. While the current version lacks detailed information for each booking, a future iteration envisions a robust full-stack solution that will revolutionize the way the IT support consultant manages their business operations.

In these upcoming iterations, the application aims to integrate a multitude of features to enhance both the consultant's workflow and the overall client experience. Some of the key enhancements include:

Automated Reminders: To reduce the occurrence of last-minute cancellations and no-shows, the system will implement automated appointment reminders. These reminders will be sent to the clients via email and text to mobiles, ensuring that they are well-informed about upcoming scheduled appointments.

Comprehensive Database: The future iteration will include a SQL database system to store and organise all booking details. This database will not only provide permanent access to booking records but also record service history, allowing the consultant to track past services, issues resolved, and recommended follow-up actions.

Frontend Website for Clients: A user-friendly frontend website will be developed to allow clients to register, log in, and book appointment requests online. Clients can conveniently browse the consultant's availability, select suitable time slots, and submit their appointment requests, improving accessibility and convenience for clients.

Deposit System: To mitigate last-minute cancellations and ensure commitment from clients, the application will introduce a deposit system. Clients may be required to make a deposit when booking appointments, which can be refunded or applied towards the service fee upon completion of the appointment.

These planned enhancements will transform the application into a comprehensive, end-to-end solution that not only addresses the consultant's current challenges but also takes their business to the next level of efficiency and customer service. By providing a seamless, integrated platform for appointment management, billing, communication, and client engagement, the consultant can focus more on delivering top-notch IT support while leaving the administrative tasks to the application.
